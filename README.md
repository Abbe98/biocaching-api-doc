#REST-API for Biocaching

This page documents the Biocaching REST-based APIs. To access Biocaching through the API you also need a username and a password. If you have that, you can invoke the API with curl on the command line: 

    curl  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -X POST "http://api.biocaching.com:82/users/sign_in" \
      -d '{"user" : { "email" : "bjorn@biocaching.com", "password" : "<PASSWORD>"}}' \

If successful, the command will return something like this: 

    {"id":1,"email":"bjorn@biocaching.com","created_at":"2016-02-16T12:36:44.000Z",
    "updated_at":"2016-02-17T13:22:08.320Z","authentication_token":"zCC868dPzS2Gp1y-UE1M"}

The token can then be used to invoke further services, for example list available taxonomies: 

    curl  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'X-User-Email: bjorn@biocaching.com' -H 'X-User-Token: zCC868dPzS2Gp1y-UE1M' \
    -X GET "http://api.biocaching.com:82/api/taxonomies" 

Also see the example programs provided.
All requests must use Content-Type application/json and must accept a response in the same content type. 


# Taxa


## Retrieve a subset of taxa
The Taxa services give access to the species database.

| fields | If omitted, only a subsets of the available fields are included in the response. Pass value "all" to have all available fields returned |
| region | Only return taxa that are found in a specific region. E.g. region=nor |
