#REST-API for Biocaching

This page documents the Biocaching REST-based APIs. To access Biocaching through the API you also need a username and a password. If you have that, you can invoke the API with curl on the command line: 

    curl  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -X POST "http://api.biocaching.com:82/users/sign_in" \
      -d '{"user" : { "email" : "bjorn@biocaching.com", "password" : "<PASSWORD>"}}' \

If successful, the command will return something like this: 

    {"id":1,"email":"bjorn@biocaching.com","created_at":"2016-02-16T12:36:44.000Z",
    "updated_at":"2016-02-17T13:22:08.320Z","authentication_token":"zCC868dPzS2Gp1y-UE1M"}

The token can then be used to invoke further services, for example list available taxonomies: 

    curl  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'X-User-Email: bjorn@biocaching.com' -H 'X-User-Token: zCC868dPzS2Gp1y-UE1M' \
    -X GET "http://api.biocaching.com:82/api/taxonomies"
